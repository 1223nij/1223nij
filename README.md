Hi! I'm a student from Vietnam currently learning CS :)

# My skills
Typescript and Javascript with Node.js
Game development with C# (using Godot and Unity game engines)
C++ for competitive programming & GUI with wxWidgets!
Experience with several database softwares:
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- MangoDB
- Firebase Realtime database

I also do some web, but I don't design very well...
- HTML and CSS
- Javascript and Typescript (like above!)
- PHP (I use PHP for my REST APIs)

Some mobile development:
- Kotlin
- Java
- Android SDK for Android apps with Android Studio

Tools I use:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)
- [Trello](https://trello.com/): For task management for my projects
- IDEs:
  + [Jetbrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/): For C# game development
  + [Jetbrains Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/): For web development (I love it with TS its awesome)
  + [Jetbrains RustRover](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/): For Rust
  + [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio): This is so slow I hate it I'm so glad I moved to React Native with Webstorm
  + [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Everything else :D

# Currently learning
- React + React Native for Native Apps (I made my first app with Android SDK and regretted it after not being able to port it to iOS)
- Rust (Just wanna see what the fuzz is all about :D)

# Currently working on
I'm working on my game that isn't on GitHub yet...
