Hi! I'm a student from Vietnam currently learning CS :)

# My skills
Typescript and Javascript with Node.js
Game development with C# (using Godot and Unity game engines)
C++ for competitive programming & GUI with wxWidgets!
Experience with several database softwares:
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- MangoDB
- Firebase Realtime database

I also do some web, but I don't design very well...
- HTML and CSS
- Javascript and Typescript (like above!)
- PHP (I use PHP for my REST APIs)

Some mobile development:
- Kotlin
- Java
- Android SDK for Android apps with Android Studio

Tools I use:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)
- [Trello](https://trello.com/): For task management for my projects
- IDEs:
  + [Jetbrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/): For C# game development
  + [Jetbrains Webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/): For web development (I love it with TS its awesome)
  + [Jetbrains RustRover](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/): For Rust
  + [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio): This is so slow I hate it I'm so glad I moved to React Native with Webstorm
  + [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Everything else :D

# Currently learning
- React + React Native for Native Apps (I made my first app with Android SDK and regretted it after not being able to port it to iOS)
- Rust (Just wanna see what the fuzz is all about :D)
- Boring courses club want me to watch:
  + [Software Engineering: Introduction](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:UBCx+SoftEng1x+2T2024/)
  + [Computer Networking: A top down approach](http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/online_lectures.htm)
  + _These courses are awesome but I'm too stupid to understand anything + I have a short attention span_

# Currently working on
I'm working on my game that isn't on GitHub yet...
I'm also contributing to a project about using LLMs to play MineCraft. Pretty epic right? [Mindcraft](https://github.com/kolbytn/mindcraft)

## My current setup:
- A ASUS 1920x1080 60hz monitor connected by HDMI (primary)
- A LG 1600x900 60hz monitor connected by VGA (secondary)
- CPU: Intel Core i5-10400
- RAM: 16GB
- No external GPU D:
- A 240GB SSD (main OS installed) and a VERY, VERY SLOW AND OLD 256GB HDD (Secondary OS installed)
- Main OS: Endeavour OS (basically arch btw)
- Secondary OS: Windows (mainly for Roblox and iOS jailbreaking stuff, so much storage wasted on this slow OS that takes 10 minutes to fully boot, its my HDD fault)
- Cool DELL office keyboard
- Cool Fuhlen??? _wth is this brand_ office mouse

# Stuff about me that doesn't relate to CS
## Hobbies
I made several Hackintoshes
- An old DELL laptop with specs:
  + TODO
  + Running macOS 11 Big Sur
  + Used Opencore Bootloader
  + Issues:
    - Audio not working
    - Broadcom (ew) wifi card is not supported so I bought a TP-Link Archer T3U
- Hackintoshed my own setup (specs above):
  + Used to ran macOS 10.15 Catalina
  + Used Opencore Bootloader
  + Issues:
    - Audio not working
    - iGPU acceleration not working (have to force resolution manually with a sketchy app... also super slow)
    - Broadcom wifi card issue again...
I've also jailbroken me and my brother's iPad (he does not enjoy it)
- An iPad mini 2 (mine :<):
  + Running iOS 12.5.7
  + Jailbroken with Chimera
- An iPad 5 (his :0):

- [Terraria](https://terraria.org/) (with [Calamity Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2824688072))
- [Geometry Dash](https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/): My hardest is [Nine Circles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOdPoU1ncOc), grinding [Windy Landscape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTX0Ch5bgMw) at 92% !!
